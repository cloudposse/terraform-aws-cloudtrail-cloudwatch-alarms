# terraform-aws-cloudtrail-cloudwatch-alarms  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cloudposse/terraform-aws-cloudtrail-cloudwatch-alarms.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cloudposse/terraform-aws-cloudtrail-cloudwatch-alarms) [![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/cloudposse/terraform-aws-cloudtrail-cloudwatch-alarms.svg)](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-cloudtrail-cloudwatch-alarms/releases) [![Slack Community](https://slack.cloudposse.com/badge.svg)](https://slack.cloudposse.com)


Terraform module for creating alarms for tracking important changes and occurances from cloudtrail.
This module creates a set of filter metrics and alarms based on the security best practices covered in the AWS guide [AWS_CIS_Foundations_Benchmark](https://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/compliance/AWS_CIS_Foundations_Benchmark.pdf).
