# terraform-aws-cloudtrail-cloudwatch-alarms  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cloudposse/terraform-aws-cloudtrail-cloudwatch-alarms.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cloudposse/terraform-aws-cloudtrail-cloudwatch-alarms) [![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/cloudposse/terraform-aws-cloudtrail-cloudwatch-alarms.svg)](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-cloudtrail-cloudwatch-alarms/releases) [![Slack Community](https://slack.cloudposse.com/badge.svg)](https://slack.cloudposse.com)


Terraform module for creating alarms for tracking important changes and occurances from cloudtrail.

This module creates a set of filter metrics and alarms based on the security best practices covered in the [AWS CIS Foundations Benchmark](https://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/compliance/AWS_CIS_Foundations_Benchmark.pdf) guide.

This project is part of our comprehensive ["SweetOps"](https://docs.cloudposse.com) approach towards DevOps. 


It's 100% Open Source and licensed under the [APACHE2](LICENSE).




## Usage

```hcl
module "cloudtrail_api_alarms" {
  source         = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-cloudtrail-cloudwatch-alarms.git"
  region         = "${var.region}"
  log_group_name = "${aws_cloudwatch_log_group.default.name}"
}
```
For detailed usage which includes setting up cloudtrail, cloudwatch logs, roles, policies, and the s3 bucket - as well as using this module see the [example directory](./examples/simple)




## Examples

Here's a complete [example](examples/simple/main.tf) of using this `terraform-aws-cloudtrail-cloudwatch-alarms` module.




## Inputs

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |
|------|-------------|:----:|:-----:|:-----:|
| add_sns_policy | Attach a policy that allows the notifications through to the SNS topic endpoint | string | `false` | no |
| additional_endpoint_arns | Any alert endpoints, such as autoscaling, or app scaling endpoint arns that will respond to an alert | list | `<list>` | no |
| create_dashboard | When true a dashboard that displays tha statistics as a line graph will be created in CloudWatch | string | `true` | no |
| log_group_name | The cloudtrail cloudwatch log group name | string | - | yes |
| metric_namespace | A namespace for grouping all of the metrics together | string | `CISBenchmark` | no |
| region | The region that should be monitored for unauthorised AWS API Access. Current region used if none provied. | string | `` | no |
| sns_topic_arn | An SNS topic ARN that has already been created. Its policy must already allow access from CloudWatch Alarms, or set `add_sns_policy` to `true` | string | `` | no |

## Outputs

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| dashboard_combined | URL to CloudWatch Combined Metric Dashboard |
| dashboard_individual | URL to CloudWatch Individual Metric Dashboard |
| sns_topic_arn | The ARN of the SNS topic used |

## Metrics Tracked

|  Alarm's Name |  Description  |
|:--------------|:--------------|
|  `AuthorizationFailureCount`  |  Alarms when an unauthorized API call is made.  | 
|  `S3BucketActivityEventCount` |  Alarms when an API call is made to S3 to put or delete a Bucket, Bucket Policy or Bucket ACL.  | 
|  `SecurityGroupEventCount`    |  Alarms when an API call is made to create, update or delete a Security Group.  | 
|  `NetworkAclEventCount`       |  Alarms when an API call is made to create, update or delete a Network ACL.  | 
|  `GatewayEventCount`          |  Alarms when an API call is made to create, update or delete a Customer or Internet Gateway.  | 
|  `VpcEventCount`              |  Alarms when an API call is made to create, update or delete a VPC, VPC peering connection or VPC connection to classic.  | 
|  `EC2InstanceEventCount`      |  Alarms when an API call is made to create, terminate, start, stop or reboot an EC2 instance.  | 
|  `EC2LargeInstanceEventCount` |  Alarms when an API call is made to create, terminate, start, stop or reboot a 4x-large or greater EC2 instance.  | 
|  `CloudTrailEventCount`       |  Alarms when an API call is made to create, update or delete a .cloudtrail. trail, or to start or stop logging to a trail.  | 
|  `ConsoleSignInFailureCount`  |  Alarms when an unauthenticated API call is made to sign into the console.  | 
|  `IAMPolicyEventCount`        |  Alarms when an API call is made to change an IAM policy.   |

## Dashboard Created

Two CloudWatch Dashboards can be created as well, and will be automatically created by default.

## Credits

The alarm metric names, descriptions, and filters [from this repository were used](https://github.com/TeliaSoneraNorge/telia-terraform-modules/tree/master/cloudtrail-forwarder).

With many thanks to [Anton Babenko](https://github.com/antonbabenko) for pointing it out and saving us a lot of time scouring reference documents and describing alarms!
