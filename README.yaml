# Short description of this project
description: |-
  Terraform module for creating alarms for tracking important changes and occurances from cloudtrail.

  This module creates a set of filter metrics and alarms based on the security best practices covered in the [AWS CIS Foundations Benchmark](https://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/compliance/AWS_CIS_Foundations_Benchmark.pdf) guide.

# How to use this project
usage: |-
  ```hcl
  module "metric_configs" {
    source  = "cloudposse/config/yaml"
    # Cloud Posse recommends pinning every module to a specific version
    # version     = "x.x.x"

    map_config_local_base_path = "./catalog"
    map_config_paths           = "*.yaml"

    context = module.this.context
  }

  module "cloudtrail_api_alarms" {
    source  = "cloudposse/cloudtrail-cloudwatch-alarms/aws"
    # Cloud Posse recommends pinning every module to a specific version
    # version     = "x.x.x"

    log_group_name = "${aws_cloudwatch_log_group.default.name}"
    metrics = module.metric_configs.map_configs
  }
  ```
  For detailed usage which includes setting up cloudtrail, cloudwatch logs, roles, policies, and the s3 bucket - as well as using this module see the [example directory](./examples/complete)
