# Short description of this project
description: |-
  Terraform module for creating alarms for tracking important changes and occurances from cloudtrail.

  This module creates a set of filter metrics and alarms based on the security best practices covered in the [AWS CIS Foundations Benchmark](https://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/compliance/AWS_CIS_Foundations_Benchmark.pdf) guide.
  
# How to use this project
usage: |-
  ```hcl
  module "cloudtrail_api_alarms" {
    source         = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-cloudtrail-cloudwatch-alarms.git"
    region         = "${var.region}"
    log_group_name = "${aws_cloudwatch_log_group.default.name}"
  }
  ```
  For detailed usage which includes setting up cloudtrail, cloudwatch logs, roles, policies, and the s3 bucket - as well as using this module see the [example directory](./examples/simple)
